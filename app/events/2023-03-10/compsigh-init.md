title: "compsigh init"
description: "Hey there! We're excited to invite you to our first major club event! Come hang out + have dinner with us and meet other cool students who are interested in CS, engineering, design, and more. Two of our goals are to design and host student-run events, and making the CS department a more engaging and social space. Throughout the semester and beyond, we'll be doing this through socials, workshops (hosted by and for students â€” that could be you!), and working closely with the department. If meeting cool people, learning useful and relevant skills, and experiencing CS in a more chill and collaborative way sound good to you, come join us! :) (Plus free food, lol) We'll be talking about these things more in detail, and how you can get involved (including leadership opportunities). It's gonna be a great time and we'd love to have you there!"
