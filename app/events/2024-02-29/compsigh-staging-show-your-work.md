## Slide notes

### Our goals as developers

Show of hands: how many of us here want to "be a software engineer"? How many of us here want to "learn (insert name of tool or language)"? How many of us here want to "contribute to open source"?

As well-intentioned as they are, these goals are vague and have variable ends.

- When are you an engineer? When you've built something yourself? When you're hired to do work as an engineer?
- When have you learned React, for example? I've built three production web apps, but haven't used Suspense, Error Boundaries, or many other React features in any of them. Does that mean I haven't "learned React"?

Our goals as developers should be specific & pointed deliverables for things we can create.

> I want to create a web app that helps me study effectively by actively engaging with my notes.

This is much better. Building goals around specific problems to solve will make delivering on them significantly easier.

### Problems to solve

**The tools we learn shouldn't precede the problems we solve them with.**

If your mindset right now is, "Damn, I *need* to build something, but I don't know what yet. Let me look up a tutorial for React," you're putting the cart before the horse. While not impossible, I can guarantee this route will be less motivating, if not less fun altogether.

We say "It's about the journey, not the destination," but the journey sucks way harder if you don't like the destination.

Think of a problem or inconvenience you or others you know have. How can you alleviate that problem? How might you make life easier, better, or more convenient for those people?

### How to learn

It's common for people self-studying programming to fall into Tutorial Hell: feeling stuck watching videos, reading Medium articles, etc. without making meaningful progress.

Guided learning — like tutorials — are great, but copy-pasting won't build problem-solving skills. A couple simple ways to incorporate experimentation, where real problem-solving skills are built, are:

- Extending the tutorial: if you're learning how to build Tic-Tac-Toe in React, go beyond the tutorial by keeping track of X and O wins, or by allowing the board size to be configured. Make it fun for yourself! What would you want to see in the kind of app the tutorial teaches you to build?
- Building related projects: once you're done going through a tutorial, see if you can leverage the same building blocks the tutorial gave you, and make something similar for yourself. Don't worry about getting stuck — when you do and are not sure how to get unstuck, put it on hold, go through another tutorial, and come back to it when you're ready.

Another underrated thing I want to point out: docs are *great*. If a language or tool has high adoption, the likelihood that the documentation will be useful is equally high. For example, Next.js has a fantastic mini-course on their site that walks you through the most important features in a real project you build alongside the course.

### How to build

**You Don't Have to Build from Scratch**

Notably, what you create doesn't always have to be from scratch: you can totally make something inspired by, or for, someone else's product. Examples include:

- Templates for Notion or website builders like Framer
- Plugins or mods for software or games
- Arc boosts

### Sharing Your Work

**Why Share?**

- Increase your visibility and exposure to potential employers or clients
  - One of the best ways to "stand out"
- Gain inspiration and ideas from others sharing their work
  - In the book, Austin Kleon talks about this notion of "in order to be interesting, you have to be interested"
  - Don't just share your work, share the work of others
  - So many ideas of mine — or finding cool tools to use for those ideas — have come from browsing the work of others, whether that be Twitter or elsewhere
- You don't have to be an expert
  - "Be a guide not a guru" —Ali Abdaal
  - CS project assignment example — who would be more helpful: a seasoned veteran, or the guy that just did it last semester?
  - In the book Austin Kleon writes about this concept of embracing your amateurism: the benefit is you get a free feedback loop from people who *are* experts or otherwise those who have more experience

**How to Share**

- Step one: open accounts on creative-oriented social networks, and spruce up existing ones
  - Get a Twitter (no, really)
    - By far the most useful social media platform to be on
  - Decorate your GitHub (no empty pfps, no first name followed by four numbers, etc.)
  - If you're into design, Dribbble
- Step two: document your progress and share it with the world
  - Share on social media platforms
  - Consider starting a blog or newsletter
  - Don't be afraid to ask for feedback — or even make it collaborative
    - Work Louder example
- Down the line, you'll be able to build an audience by consistently engaging with others in your community, and of course, sharing your work

### Resources

This workshop was heavily inspired by [Theo's video on engineering goals](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rzwaaWH0ksk), a fantastic watch, as well as Austin Kleon's book, *Show Your Work*, a great read.
