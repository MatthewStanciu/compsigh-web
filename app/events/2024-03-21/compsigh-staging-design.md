title: "compsigh staging: design"
description: "compsigh staging sessions are high-quality, low-stakes, one-hour technical workshops where participants walk away with a new skill, while having built something along the way. in a world where it's easier than ever to build software, it's on us to stand out. learn from Edward how design will make you a better programmer, and how to start crafting beautiful interfaces today."

## Slide notes

today, we'll be covering:

- relevance of design in the tech industry
- how design will make you a better programmer
- Figma tutorial

### notes

- why learn design
  - it is easier than ever today to build software. while that's a great thing for the world, that also puts the onus on us to stand out. what helps stand out? design.
  - you can visually represent what it is you want to build, without dependence on drawing skills
  - by becoming better at design, through pattern recognition, taste building, and the practice itself, you inherently become better at tangential skills. we're doing interface design but it'll carry over to graphic design, print design, art, photography, architecture, etc.
    - becoming better at design = becoming better at visually capturing and communicating your ideas
  - and it pays well lol — startups would much rather hire someone that can do both than an engineer and a designer (plus, designers aren't learning how to code)
- how to "start design"
  - "build your palate" analogy: if you've been eating one cuisine all your life, you just *don't know* what you're missing in foreign cuisines
  - in contrast, though, we're all "consumers" of good design, and while we can distinguish good from bad, we're not really conscious of those distinctions. so it really starts with being more conscious: build taste — your design palate. construct a dataset of things you like and things you don't. figure out why you like/dislike those things.
- design exercise: compsigh login form
  - the form has rounded corners and the login button is red and rectangular. what's the problem?
    - non-destructive action depicted as destructive (GitHub repo danger zone example)
    - the branding does not line up — it'd be ok if compsigh's primary color was red (and even then, primary non-destructive buttons are usually distinguished from destructive buttons e.g. one is outline, one is filled — Airbnb example)
    - the rectangular corners of the button don't mesh with the rounded corners of the input fields
- ux patterns
  - Discord no-esc or clickaway when modal (events)
  - Instagram "remove follower?" when unfollowing
