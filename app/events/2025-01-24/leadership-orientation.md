## Agenda

- Addressing any gaps in onboarding: phone numbers, email addresses, schedules
- Revisiting areas of improvement noted during [last leadership meeting](/events/2024-12-05/semester-debrief)
- Going over [framework](/docs/framework)
- Reviewing + adjusting leadership roles & responsibilities [from last semester](/events/2024-08-27/leadership-type-shit)
- Planning first compsigh night according to framework documentation
- Discussing opening up compsigh nights semi-privately to people our age in SF
- Introducing & scaffolding a timeline for the big events: cascade, BLOOM (we should *announce* both at first compsigh night)
- Planning for Spring Involvement Fair
- Going over ideas mentioned in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/compsigh/web/issues)
- Inaugurating Nish
- Disassembling the Winter night tree

## Radar

- compsigh LLC
- Leadership transition â€” introing Jet to contacts
- Should we be looking to continue expanding leadership this semester, given the gap that is Summer break?
