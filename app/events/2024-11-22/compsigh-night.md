description: "just two compsigh nights left! if you're into workshops, tonight's your night: we have THREE of them. one on how to design and why programmers should learn, another on getting started with web development using React & Next.js, and finally, a very practical one: show your work! this work(shop) (lol) is all about how to set constructive goals for learning & building, tips for starting a project & documenting your progress, and why sharing your work is important for your professional and personal growth. pull up to nerd out on design-engineering, to turn your projects into stories, or just to hang out at compsigh night!"
