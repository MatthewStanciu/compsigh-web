we did it y'all; week one of Fall 2024 in the books ðŸŒ»

over Summer, after some long-overdue grass-touching, we set out to build what we've been dreaming of for a while: a home to bring together our events calendar, members' projects, and all things compsigh. we're so hyped to show it to you :)

this post is about what the new **compsigh web platform** is for, why we built it, and how it can help you. later on I can write up a technical & aesthetics deep-dive if people are interested!

## Purpose

the vision for the platform is this:

- we document the club's purpose and values, particularly for future iterations of leadership, so that the club is more durable and sustainable over time
- we use an accessible source of truth for events, with integrations for comms outside of Discord (several members have requested text/email notis)
- we reliably present the club and what we're up to, for those not yet in the community (incoming freshmen, potential donors/sponsors, etc.)

here's how we get there:

## Platform

first and foremost, [the web platform is entirely open-source](https://github.com/compsigh/web). this enables the project to be extensible and collaborative by nature. this is an important part of [our club's culture](/docs/values) â€” we embrace building in public, and regularly engage with others for feedback. posting about the platform in our `#workshop` channel has undoubtedly made it better.

[the docs](/docs) are a collection of notes about the club. each time we run into a new challenge, we'll document how we overcame it.

[the events page](/events) centralizes every one of our gatherings over the last year and a half â€” a timeline of compsigh lore.

finally, [the community page](/community) showcases what our members are up to. this is my personal favorite. like `#workshop`, but bigger. a celebration of our open, supportive, ambitious, creative culture.

## Process

speaking of the community page, there's one feature I'm really excited about: [sharing your work on the platform](/docs/web-platform/why-publish). this is *huge*. a timeless struggle for us as CS majors is *sharing our work*. it's hard: imposter syndrome, the hurdle of making a website to put content on, etc.

we're working to make the club the best place for us to just start sharing. one where we own our data, one to help us get discovered on the Internet, and one where we can just write words, not code.

I *highly* recommend using the web platform to write about your personal projects *(or favorite projects from class!)*. if you're not familiar with forking a project on GitHub and/or writing Markdown, no worries: the guide will teach you everything you need to know. and if you want to go more in-depth, Gursh is leading our first **compsigh clone** workshop next week on Git and GitHub.

I hope y'all enjoy the web platform as much as I did making it :) aside from an opportunity to flex my web dev and design work LOL, it's a testament to the fact that *you can make something like it too*, and compsigh is the place to do it.
