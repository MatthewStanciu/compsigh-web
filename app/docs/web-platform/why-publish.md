one of the timeless struggles we face as CS majors is *getting our projects out there.* sharing our work is one of the best ways to increase discoverability, hirability, and serendipity for new opportunities.

when starting from scratch, it can seem pretty daunting: we need to think about not just the material, but the formatting, styling, and *where to publish the damn thing!*

so, with the **community** tab here on the web platform, we're looking to make compsigh the best place for us to *just write about our work.* here's how:

- 🔑 **we own it:** by having a local copy of the repo, we actually own what we write. no scammy vendor lock-in where platforms make it unnecessarily hard to export our content
- 💅 **styles built in:** we want to write words, not CSS. watch a text file turn into a well-formatted, clean page
- 🌐 **discoverability win-win:** as of July 2024 *(before the web platform is even live!)*, the club has three links on the first page of a "compsigh" Google search. the more content we put out → better discoverability for all of us → better discoverability *for you and your work!*
