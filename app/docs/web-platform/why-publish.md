One of the timeless struggles we face as <CasePreserver>CS</CasePreserver> majors is *getting our projects out there.* Sharing our work is one of the best ways to increase discoverability, hireability, and serendipity for new opportunities.

When starting from scratch, it can seem pretty daunting: we need to think about not just the material, but the formatting, styling, and *where to publish it!*

So, with the <span style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-proto-mono)', fontWeight: '600', textShadow: '0 0 10px var(--color-compsigh-60)' }}>[community](/community)</span> tab here on the web platform, we're looking to make compsigh the best place for us to *just write about our work.* Here's how:

- 🔑 **We own it:** By having a local copy of the repo, we actually own what we write. No scammy vendor lock-in where platforms make it unnecessarily hard to export our content.
- 💅 **Styles built in:** We want to write words, not <CasePreserver>CSS</CasePreserver>. Watch a text file turn into a well-formatted, clean page.
- 🌐 **Discoverability:** As of <CasePreserver>July</CasePreserver> 2024, the club has three links on the first page of a "compsigh" <CasePreserver>Google</CasePreserver> search. The more content we put out → better discoverability for all of us → better discoverability *for you and your work!*
