compsigh is for CS majors â€” and our friends from other walks of creative study â€” looking to take back the director's seat

we are coming together to create a social and supportive community around learning new things, and building fun & experimental projects

we are goal-agnostic: whether you're pursuing a job at FAANG, doing your own thing, or just looking to hang out with wholesome, like-minded people, you'll find a home here ðŸ’› âœ¨
