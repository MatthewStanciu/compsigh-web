Instead of running applications for leadership, members are invited to join.

An invited club member is:

- Genuinely passionate about what the club stands for
- Likely to contribute to an objective club leadership is focusing on
- Regularly showing up, engaged, and supportive, both online and offline
- Motivated to expand their skillset (e.g. getting better at graphic design by working on promo material)

Here's what a typical invite process looks like:

1. Leadership notices the engagement and contributions of a club member.
2. A recommendation is made, and the team discusses internally.
3. If the president approves, the club member is invited.
4. If the club member accepts, they are onboarded.

Members join the team on a rolling basis, and have no term limits.
