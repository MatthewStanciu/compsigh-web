## It's an ✨ event ✨

It's not a "meeting". It's an *event*.

This is a contrived example meant to convey that the language we use matters, and we reject typical college club corpo mumbo jumbo.

## Open source

We embrace building in public, and regularly engage with others for feedback. Everything — from workshop notes to the expense tracker — should be open source.

## Go for it

We <CasePreserver>CS</CasePreserver> majors are too used to following the script. We believe this is antithetical to the idea of college itself. In reality, this is *the best time* in our lives to try new things, make mistakes, learn from them, and make something great.

Don't wait for permission. Go for it.
